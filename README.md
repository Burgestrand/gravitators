# Gravitators

When I was a kid, I had a game. In this game, you would pilot a tiny little spacecraft, fly around in zero gravity, and try to shoot down one of your friends.

You would initially drive straight into walls, crashland into the ground, or even collide head-on with your rival.

After some time you learn to navigate your vessel. You shoot at each other, pick up items to improve your weapons, accidentally kill yourself with your own bullets, and sometimes you would score a clean bullseye on your rival.

It was Gravitation: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX3NlMgAEcQ>. [Gravitators](http://gravitators.herokuapp.com/) is my remake.

## Roadmap

There is no timeline. However, there are a few things Iâ€™d like to have before I consider it finished.

- Multiplayer (local at first, possibly extending to network play)
- Three levels (one containing a huge ring mass and a nice power up in the middle)
- Power ups (speed bonus, reverse gravity, gravity push, invincibility)
- Weapons (high-rate gun, spiral gun, gun firing backwards, exploding bullets)

## Development

```
git clone git@github.com:Burgestrand/gravitators.git
cd gravitators
bundle
rake server
